# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**antigravity-nix** is an auto-updating Nix Flake that packages Google Antigravity (a proprietary agentic IDE) for NixOS systems. It uses browser automation to detect new versions and automatically creates PRs with updates 3x weekly.

**Key Challenge**: Antigravity is a binary distribution that requires a standard Linux filesystem layout, which conflicts with NixOS's unique structure. This is solved using `buildFHSEnv` to create an isolated FHS environment.

## Architecture

### Two-Stage Build Process

1. **antigravity-unwrapped** (package.nix:53-77): Extracts the upstream tarball into `/nix/store` without modification
2. **FHS Environment** (package.nix:80-135): Wraps the binary in a container with standard Linux paths and all required libraries

### Chrome Integration Strategy

Antigravity requires Chrome to be available. The package creates a Chrome wrapper (package.nix:44-50) that:
- Forces use of the user's existing Chrome profile (`~/.config/google-chrome`)
- Ensures any Chrome extensions the user has installed are available to Antigravity
- Sets `CHROME_BIN` and `CHROME_PATH` environment variables (package.nix:128-129)

### Version Detection Architecture

The update workflow uses **browser automation** (not curl) because Antigravity's download page is JavaScript-rendered:

- `scripts/scrape-version.js`: Playwright-based scraper that loads the page with a real browser
- `scripts/check-version.sh`: Quick version comparison (current vs. latest)
- `scripts/update-version.sh`: Full update process (version + hash + build test)

**Important**: The scraper requires `playwright-chromium` to be installed and browsers to be downloaded (`npx playwright install chromium`).

## Common Commands

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the package
nix build .#default

# Test run without installing
nix run .#default

# Build and check flake
nix flake check

# Update flake lock
nix flake update
```

### Version Management

```bash
# Check for new version (no changes)
./scripts/check-version.sh

# Update to latest version (modifies files, builds, commits)
./scripts/update-version.sh

# Manually test version scraping
node scripts/scrape-version.js
```

**Prerequisites for version scripts**:
- Node.js 20+
- `npm install -g playwright-chromium`
- `npx playwright install chromium`

### GitHub Workflows

**Manual triggers via `gh` CLI**:

```bash
# Manually trigger update workflow
gh workflow run update.yml

# Trigger with specific inputs
gh workflow run cleanup-branches.yml -f dry_run=true

# View workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=update.yml
gh run view <run-id>
```

## Important Implementation Details

### Hash Updates

When updating versions, the hash must be updated in two steps (scripts/update-version.sh:96-121):

1. Download with `nix-prefetch-url` to get base hash
2. Convert to SRI format with `nix hash to-sri`
3. Update `package.nix` with the SRI hash (`sha256-...`)

**Never** use fake/placeholder hashes - the build will fail and CI won't catch it until runtime.

### FHS Environment Dependencies

The `targetPkgs` list (package.nix:83-123) includes all libraries Antigravity needs. If adding new dependencies:

- Include both the library and its transitive dependencies
- Add X11 libraries with `xorg.` prefix
- Include `stdenv.cc.cc.lib` for C++ standard library
- Test on a minimal NixOS system, not just your development machine

### Workflow Integration

The three workflows work together:

1. **update.yml**: Runs 3x weekly, creates PRs, enables auto-merge
2. **release.yml**: Triggers on `package.nix` changes to main, creates GitHub releases
3. **cleanup-branches.yml**: Deletes merged `auto-update/*` branches

**Release workflow** (release.yml) only runs when:
- `package.nix` is modified
- Version in `flake.nix` changed compared to previous commit
- Release tag doesn't already exist

### Version String Format

Antigravity uses the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD_NUMBER`

Example: `1.11.2-6251250307170304`

This appears in three files:
- `flake.nix` line 58: metadata for consumers
- `package.nix` line 36: used in derivation
- Both must be updated together

## Testing Checklist

Before committing changes to packaging:

```bash
# 1. Verify build succeeds
nix build .#default --rebuild

# 2. Test the binary runs
./result/bin/antigravity --version

# 3. Verify flake metadata
nix flake metadata

# 4. Check for evaluation errors
nix flake check

# 5. Test on actual system (if modifying FHS env)
nix run .#default  # Launch full GUI
```

## Common Issues

### "Could not find Chrome" errors

The FHS wrapper sets `CHROME_BIN`/`CHROME_PATH` to a wrapper script, not the actual Chrome binary. If Antigravity can't find Chrome:

1. Verify `google-chrome` is in system packages
2. Check the wrapper script path in package.nix:44-50
3. Test: `CHROME_BIN=/path/to/wrapper /path/to/wrapper --version`

### Version scraping fails

The scraper requires JavaScript rendering. Common failures:

- **"playwright not found"**: Run `npm install -g playwright-chromium`
- **"executable not found"**: Run `npx playwright install chromium`
- **Timeout errors**: Increase timeout in scrape-version.js:23 (currently 30s)
- **No version found**: The page structure changed - update selectors in scrape-version.js:30-53

### Workflow doesn't create PR

Check GitHub Actions logs. Common causes:

1. Version hasn't changed (intentional - exits cleanly)
2. Playwright not installed (CI installs it, but check workflow output)
3. Build failed (hash mismatch or missing dependencies)
4. Permissions issue (workflow needs `contents: write`)

## Updating This Package

### For New Antigravity Versions

The automated workflow handles this. To manually update:

```bash
./scripts/update-version.sh
# Reviews output, commits if successful
git push
```

### For Packaging Changes

When modifying `package.nix` or `flake.nix`:

1. Test locally with multiple build approaches
2. Verify the FHS environment includes all necessary libraries
3. Test with `nix run .#default` on a clean NixOS VM if possible
4. Check that the desktop entry works (`antigravity` command from launcher)

### For Workflow Changes

When modifying `.github/workflows/*.yml`:

1. Test with `gh workflow run <workflow>.yml`
2. Check workflow syntax: `gh workflow view <workflow>.yml`
3. Monitor with `gh run list --workflow=<workflow>.yml`
4. Validate secrets/permissions are correct
